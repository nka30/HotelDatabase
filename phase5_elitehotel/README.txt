First, the database must be replicated on your machine. To do this, run all the code we have attached or use the exported database we have attached. Then, run app.py. The IP address shown on the console is the web address from which you can access the web interface. From there, you can go to each table via the descriptive buttons which link them. We have displays for all the tables which you can access from the home page. When linked to the table page, there is a display of the table and you can add/edit/delete entries. We also have links in the home page for our complex queries, some of which require the user to insert a value to display a result.
